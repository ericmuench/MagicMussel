# Magic Mussel
## Description
This Android-App is a Just-For-Fun App about the Magic Mussel from Spongebob that can give funny answers. It was my first attempt to programm an Android App with Kotlin. 
The App has the following features:

- Getting a random answer from the magic mussel by tapping it (Answer can be seen as Toast Message and heard as Audio TTS)
- Adding own answers for the magic mussel
- Language Support for English, German and Spanish (Basic answers like Yes, No and Maybe are translated automatically. Own answers need to be translated manually by the user)
- Day- and Night-Mode which changes the Bikini-Bottom-Landscape to Day or Night depending on the phones environment using the phones Light-Sensor
